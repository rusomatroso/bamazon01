Node and Mysql project


__Customer's side:__

The app should: 
- ask them the ID of the product customer would like to buy.
- ask how many units of the product customer would like to buy.

After customer's selection the data is displayed and data base updated.

__Manager's side:__

The manager can select:
- View Products for Sale, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
- View Low Inventory, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.
- Add to Inventory, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
- Add New Product, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

 
Please watch a demo video to see how the app work:
